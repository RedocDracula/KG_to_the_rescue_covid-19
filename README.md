### Currently, I'm working with team where we have multiple projects. My target is to make a Semantic Query Engine backed with Knowledge Graph.
### Step 1:
<ul> Grab and integrate data sources and enrich Knowledge in Graph</ul>
### Step 2:
<ul> Devise Semantic Queries</ul>
### Step 3:
<ul> Integrate Semantic Queries with KG</ul>
# Tools:
#### Neo4j (My First Graph Database Love!)
#### Python (Flask)
