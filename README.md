# Knowledge Graph To The Rescue Covid-19
This Repository will be used to maintain/ aware people about KG for Covid-19
### Currently, I'm working with team where we have multiple projects. My target is to make a Semantic Query Engine backed with Knowledge Graph.
### Step 1:
<ul><li> Grab and integrate data sources and enrich Knowledge in Graph</li></ul>

### Step 2:
<ul><li> Devise Semantic Queries</li></ul>

### Step 3:
<ul><li> Integrate Semantic Queries with KG </li></ul>

# Tools:
#### Neo4j (My First Graph Database Love!)
#### Python (Flask)

# Graph Model
